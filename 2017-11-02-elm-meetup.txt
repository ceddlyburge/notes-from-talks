Bikeshedding is arguing about things that don't matter, eg colour of the bike shed

api for elm packages

starts simple
then support xml and json
then supprt only getting specific fields
the think about returning errors
/package or /packages
filtering
sorting
paging

http://jsonapi.org
a standard to agree all this stuff so don't need to argue

# Guerilla Elm

Used at microsoft for a dashboard that couldn't fail
then used for a startup
elm good for web pages
elm is easier to learn than most functional shizzle

doesn't have as many libraries, so need to bring in some javascript libraries, so need to use ports / web components
some web apis are missing (don't know what this means)
elm-lang issue 19 is a problem (no isready type function)

no language as good for the back end yet.
