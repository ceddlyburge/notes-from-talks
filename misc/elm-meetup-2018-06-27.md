elm notes 
jade
product manager thought of building new pages in elm
did side by side with react / redux. elm won.
takes less time to get up to speed with elm
other teams reluctant to use already written elm things
found it frustrating that elm team couldn't just use other teams code as well
elm gives a faster rendering and faster perceived speed time
elm not that well documented. slack is really good though.
