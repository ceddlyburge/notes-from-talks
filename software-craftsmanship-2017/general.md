# Things I can try doing back at the office
 
Usability testing on our code.

Try and get some kind of code retreat going. Preferably not actual work, but us all doing the same thing.
- if we do one of the ogranised ones that will save a lot of organsising time
- and the fact that a lot of people are doing it is a good sign that it is a good thing to do.

Try and do more exercism things or similar

Book club

Lunchtime things with lunch. Maybe exercism things.

motivation matters more than talent. interesting for recruitment.

developer exchange? swap developers between non competing companies. Get some fresh ideas in. Just for a week maybe. rachels company insisted on the other company being an xp company so that they paired and got the most out of it.

do coding dojos instead of the current code reviews.

steve to do a talk on clean code when he comes back from the training course.
