# System Metaphors

eg desktop os mimics the actual top of a desktop

early smart phones had screens that looked like phones

Scratch has a block meatphor

They help people learn the new thing

They have a sell by date, so after a while, have a desktop that looks like a desktop is actually unhelpful.

Some die as well. eg kick the bucket. Logging (which was an actual log thrown out the back of a ship)

So they are technical debt.

# Figurative metaphor

logging, kick the bucket

# Cognitive metaphor

we live in the physical world and in social groups. Anything more abstract we interpret as a metaphor.

more of a thing relates to up. eg soaring prices, means prices are going up. Top 10& of earners. Earnings fell. etc.

Higher level of abstraction. higher order functions.

hence hardware at the bottom. Application at the top of an architecture diagram. Then user interface goes on top, which fits the metaphor, but is actuallyl wrong.

people are up, eg uu at the top.

control is at the top. eg interface / abstract clas at top.

Metaphorical blinkers. in allowing us to focus on things that fit in with the metaphor, it stops us focusing on things that are inconsisten with the metaphor. eg someone had a desktop background with difference colours and arranged files in these colours areas instead of using the folder system.

Nat changed a diagram for manuscript submission form a linear diagram to a circular diagram, to aid thinking about the project.

Metaphors precede conways law (that a programs structure mimics the organisational metahpe)

# summary

Metaphors help and hinder

Figurative metaphor is technical debt, think about how you are going to move on when it stops being useful.

Cognitive metaphor is inescapable (up is better etc)

Metaphors precede conways law and can be used to change the way we organise ourselves in groups. So 4 teams writing a compiler will makde a 4 pass compiler. "Pass" is the metaphor, if we used a different metaphor, we might get a 4 something else metaphor.

A lot of it is unconscious. Could be used to help semi enforce things you want enforced.

The domain people might be making the metaphors, so maybe programmers need to get involved with the domain and change things there.
