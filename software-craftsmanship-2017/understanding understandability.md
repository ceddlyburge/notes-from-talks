eye tracking experiments show that the average time spent per word of source code is constant. so half the code means half the time required to understand it. Not sure I really agree with this though.

We should all get used to the higher level functions that can be used, which allows us to be more terse, and is understandle as long as everybody has the same vocabulary / knows what the functions do.

Different programming paradigms, like apl and j, alloq us to conceptualise things in different ways. And maybe better / terser ways.

polynomial example: edge cases make functional / fluent syntax tricky. Some complexity happened in term and some in collection code, so mixed levels of abstraction.

Favour locality. keep code to do a thing visible / close / together.

We should move towards higher level operations. Although not always as in the polynomial example.
