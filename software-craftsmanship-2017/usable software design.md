Designing code to be easy to use by subsequent programmers

So the _user_ is a programmer that hasn't seen the code before.

Usability

- learnability
- satisfaction
- memorability
- errors
- efficiency 

User interviews

- What was diffiult to do in the past weeks
- What areas of the code were most difficult to understand
- When were you afraid that your changes might be wrong

Can also do usability testing on your code, as per don't make me think. So look at someone working with your code, encourage them to vocalise what they are thinking.

team agreement
- code written to be read
- easy to find where to make a modification
- minimial ripple
- simple and easy to validate
- limited duplication

Can talk about the usability criteria during code reviews

Listen to your users, don't obey them

Code should be written for a beginner programmer, in the same way that programmers should be easy to use by new users
