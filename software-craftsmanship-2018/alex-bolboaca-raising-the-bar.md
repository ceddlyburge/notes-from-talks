# Raising the bar

## Usable software design

Can we use ux techniques for our code.
- personas
- user journeys. navigation smells
- usability testing

## design studies

Designers in other disciplines will ake many rough designs before picking one

## materials science

code as a physical materials

forces
- change
- execution

mechanical properties
- rigidity, unevenly distributed

## maths

maybe can refactor to a big ugly pure function, and then split in to smaller ones and then group by cohesion. hmmmm.

## engineering

tests become part of production code, app can self test. like the thing on software chips that somebody mentioned.

## science

someone should write something to upload static code analysis to a public repository for scientists to analyse

## fundamental change

write specs in given when then (which is a state machine)
have a thing which turns the requirements in to an app.
