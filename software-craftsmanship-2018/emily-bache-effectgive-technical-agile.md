# Effective technical agile

emily bache has writtent the coding dojo book

Doing tdd in katas is quite possible, but often difficult to transfer to production code

mob programming helps with this

there are a couple of books
- driver just types
- navigataor instructs
- everyone else is usually quiet, unless discussion started by the navigataor

Learning hour helps. daily. invite all programmers. code katas, learn theory
