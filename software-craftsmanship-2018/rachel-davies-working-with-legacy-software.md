# Strategies for working with legacy code

Did some mapping on the code for anything that was external. using post its.

used an auto tool to generate a data model. This showed that the student class was doing way too much

made an invevntory
- what does the business use? need?
- what 3rd part systems do we use (some not used so could save money)

shadowing, sat with users to see how they were using it.

fixed some bugs. flag in phone number field. Initially just removed the flag. this required some negotiation with the business.

made a web sequence diagram. messages been passed between all the web bits. used to chat with the finance person when the 3rd party api was being changed. Decided to just do the job manually in the end.

metaphors. cars need servicing, as does code. Need to update libraries, latest versions of language etc.

sunk cost fallacy. Its not an assett if its not bringing in value. And it is probably still costing.

lots of big unmerged branches. had to see iff these were valuable or not. kept one deleted the rest. Sounds like this was quite a big job.

Keep a log of things changed / done. Can explain yourself to people, and have some satisfaction.
