# Robert Martin - The crafstmans oath

Should be proud of the way we work as well as the products we produce. This engenders trust with management.

## I will not produce harmful code

- self driving cars, medical, power stations etc
- volkswagen
- dont harm parent company, don't make a mess

## The code that I produce will always be my best work

## I will produce with each release, a quick sure and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should

testing is like double entry book keeping

## I will make frequent small releases so that i do not impede the progress of others

Applies to requirements as well, and everything else

## I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve our work at every opportunity. I will never allow it to degrade

Being afraid of some scary code stops us refactoring it

## I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself and others, as high as possible.

eg by leaving holes in the tests, or by writing bad code, or by being a dick

## I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and I can cover for them.

## I will roduce estimates that are honest in both magnitude and precision

1 week if perfect, 3 weeks usually, 10 weeks if a disaster

Dont allow yourself to be changed by a manager

## I will never stop learning and improving my craft
