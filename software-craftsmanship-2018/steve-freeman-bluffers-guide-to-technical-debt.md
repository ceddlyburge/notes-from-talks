# Bluffers guide to technical debt

tech debt not about bad code

Habitability. The mugs and teaspoons and kettle and tea bags are normally close together. 

tech debt is socio economic, nomads couldn't make tea easily

tech debt is non linear, it can blow up in your face

no point fixing stuff you won't change

Product owner should take ownership of the debt - mention this at next mgmt meeting

cost of delay relates to tech debt. if cost of delay is low can afford to sort out the debt. but sorting out the tech debt means we can go faster, so actually better to sort it out then.

You can think of it as an option. eg a share option to be able to be able to buy a share for an agreed price. Booking a hotel room is looking this. lose 10% to cancel. so the option costs 10% basically.

The opposite is also true, you can sell an option. This is a different metaphor for tech debt.

Most of the time you don't get called up on it, but it can blow up and hurt you if a big change is required. It increases delay so cost of delay is relevant.

project hurricane map slide is interesting, although it requires you to know where all the debt is, and what bits of code will be worked on / touched soon.
