# Being unruly - an xp journey

use ideas from lean startup

use most of xp

dont use
- backlog
- ci servers
- very little estimating / story points / velocity etc

craft stuff
- 20% time to do stuff that you think will be valuable
- mentoring
- pairing / mobbing
- no rigid deadlines
- pyschological safety (say what think, union of our knowledge, not intersection of our ignorance)
- diversity
- conference / laptop allowance
- explicit career development responsibilities

Its quite easy to maintain practices
its difficult to retain the organisational memory of the intent behind the practices

dont track code coverage
dont do automated static code analysis
dont have build pipelines

## planning

quarterly goal, chosen by exec team
- self organise within this

easy to confuse "once appropriate and succcessful" for "currently a failure". Was it always a failure, or was it good previously.

elegance is essential for sustainable value

lencionis five dysfunctions of a team
- ignore reults
- avoid accountability
- no commitment
- fear of conflict
- no trust

They have a set of working agreements for each team

unruly is a good example of a long term xp startup company

Hiring

phone interview, chat about cv, most people pass

face to face interview on prem. design exercise. c review. 1 hour pairing java and javascript. Could they explain what they were doing.

never rejected anybody on the basis of cultural fit. Have on the basis that people were reluctant to receive feedback. Or didn't pick up a new thing quickly.

they do continuous feedback, there's not pdrs.
