frances has made an ai type thing to code up fizzbuzz using genetic programming

has written a book. genetic algorithms ...

starts off with a tree structure for the genetic programming. operators, variable names, brackets maybe, and it combines these

it needs some tests. they are the feedback for machine learning (and for us)

took several days to generate the code. the created code was bad.

use mutation testing. property based testing.

hypothesis does property based testing in python.
