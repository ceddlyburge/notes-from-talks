Delays in feedback cause oscillations, like showers that heat on demand, but not immediately, and there is a lag between moving the dial and the temp of the water. 2 systems influencing each other.

feedback loops allow us to control complicated things, that are too complicated to reason about, in a simple way. Like an autopilot, which just measures the inclination / direction of the plane and adjusts accordingly. A bit like canary releasing.

tdd doesn't tell you that the design is good, but they do tell you when they are bad. they give you feedback (eg tests are slow or hard to write), but you still have to action that feedback.

similar for scrum

feedback without an action is not a loop, uts just bad news. experts know what to do with the feedback, but beginners do not.

drawbacks of feedback loops
- create coupling between parts of a systems
- can introduce instability, like the showers
- it costs and adds complexity to add sensors and action

instability
- meausring the wrong things
- measuring the right thing but in wrong way (eg long feedback)

exception tracking is better feedback than code coverage. were doing ok here, half of companies don't track this.

how frequently do you obserce users using your software? Its not enough to ask, you have to observe. were doing ok here as well, but we should probably make it first class. Tend to do it when doing support at the moment, and its a side benefit rather than the main point.

This is expensive to do, so often gets ignored as a metric. But maybe its justified when you think about what decisions it could inform.
