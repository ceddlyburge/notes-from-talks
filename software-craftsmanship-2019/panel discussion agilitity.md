# how get feedback on architecture / quality

"arch unit" can do some of this, gets actual metrics which you can put in the build pipeline or whatever

proof of concepts etc

maybe the accelerate metrics

maybe some things that the business wants (more frequent releases, monitor in production, exceptions or whatever), can measure that and then see if the architecture supports it.
