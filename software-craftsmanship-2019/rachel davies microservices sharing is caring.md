tes (this is a company name)
50 devs, full stack but all javascript
200 microservices
remote first culture

have standardised the services on js react / node / rest / rabbit mq

people architecture and software architecture are linked. If you want lots of small services, have lots of small teams.

each team has a project parent, which is a normal dev that organises the start up etc. They do a light touch agile.

they have a style guide, that has css and react components and such in it. Looks like a living style guide to me. they have an optional day a month to maintain this. each team supplies as many people as they want. like the guild model at spotify.

some backend shared services as well. an emailer. a pdf generator etc

strong on tests and documentation

things are packaged for consumption. the pdf creator has a good readme and a preview mode

there are 2 hack days per month

they are going to have tech debt days soon

starting a dx group (developer experience)

to make things simple across services
- naming convetions
- engineering guide
- tech standards
- ask on slack

culture
- post mortems on outages
- champions (like ilya for the ram)
- helping others
- mentoring. everyone has one, meet every 2 weeks
- knowledge sharing
