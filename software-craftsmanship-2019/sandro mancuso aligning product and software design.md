#noprojects

software products have no start and end.

projects only care about then edn goal, not about the means to get there. software does care, because it has to continue afterwards and tech debt is a problem.

Should merge agile and traditional project management. Traditional is basically waterfall, and we need to make it iterative.

Make sure plans are feasible / viable. This step is rarely missed, and plans are more aspirational. This definitely happens at RES. Directional of travel is important, but need dto continously get value out in little increments. Programmers need to be involved early on in the process to make this happen.

common understanding on goals, problems, value proposition etc is a useful thing. programmers and product owners should all share this.

could definitely make this point in my write up
