dont mock what you don't own

## explicit contract

a nut and a bolt have explicitit contract on size and thread

function on an interface

## impliciti contract

length of bolt could be an issue depending on context. (not enough space to tightnen)

same with bolt with a shank, might not be thick enough to get past the shank.

something implied by the name of the function on an interface (eg add)

maybe something implied about throwing exceptions, not creating overflow etc

## contract testing

contract test runs against the test double, and against the system you are stubbing out.

test doubles make assumptions about the contract. contract tests try to justify those assumptions.

tests the implicit contract basically

should be run against the double and againts production thing

abstract class with tests, with 2 descendants for the test double and production
