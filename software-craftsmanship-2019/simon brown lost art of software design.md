big design up front is bad, but no design up front is even worse

simon gives people a functional spec, and asks them to draw an architecture diagram

then asks if the diagram addresses the spec, and if you would buy the solution.

whiteboard / post it note designs don't work

use uml

maybe I should do some diagrams for league tables

recommends "just enough software architecture" book

message is that we should do some design. and probably use diagrams.

make the significant decisions (things that are costly to change)

initial decisions
- language
- technologies and platforms
- monolith or microservices?

teams need a ubiquitous language to communicate effectively (maybe uml)

talks about c4 model, different levels of architecture

system context diagram
 - scope?
 - who is using it
 - what are they doing
 - how do they do it

container diagram 
 - high level tech blocks
 - what are their responsibilities
 - how do they communicate
 
diagrams should apark meaningful questions, and provide the ubiquitous language

amplifies sandro mancuso's talk. get the tech people involved earlier in the process.
