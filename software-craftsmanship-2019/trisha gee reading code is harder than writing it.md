why read code
 - review / critique
 - how can i use it
 - how can i change it
 
should be more focussed on trying to understand it

assumptions that were used / known when writing the code are forgotten when reading the code

 - practice reading code. reading is not reviewing
 - dont judge, make notes (questions, discoveries, assumptions)
 - draw diagrams
